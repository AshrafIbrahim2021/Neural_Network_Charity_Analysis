# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
      create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

   1-	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
      The target data is the IS_SUCCESSFUL field.

   2-	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
      The features are as following:
      APPLICATION_TYPE
      AFFILIATION
      CLASSIFICATION
      USE_CASE
      ORGANIZATION
      STATUS
      INCOME_AMT
      SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
      ASK_AMT

  3-	What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
      Variables that neither targets nor features are EIN and NAME.
      
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  4-	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
      The layers are 8 and 5. The activation function is relu Activation.

  5-	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
      No.

  6-	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
      Increased the neurons and layers.


## Summary
